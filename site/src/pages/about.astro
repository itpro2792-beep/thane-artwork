      <h2>An Innate Calling</h2>
      <p>
        "I find that expressing myself artistically is not a choice; it is what I have been born to do, just like some people have a talent for car mechanics or baking. Whatever that higher power is out there channels through me via the arts."
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Ann has explored a variety of mediums, from mixed-media illustrations and pyrography to jewelry and the living soul of clay. Her work is a journey of discovery, a conversation between the material and the spirit.
      </p>
      <h2>From Public Service to Personal Art</h2>
      <p>
        Ann's creative journey is interwoven with a life of public service. As the former Mayor of the City of Amsterdam, she managed a $32M budget and over 200 employees. Her personal blog, <a href="https://wildthane.wordpress.com" target="_blank">wildthane.wordpress.com</a>, served as a conduit for communication and a space to explore passions beyond the political sphere. This blend of civic responsibility and deep artistic expression informs the unique perspective evident in her work today.
