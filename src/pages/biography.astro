        <p>I&#8217;ve always been an artist. I must have been clawing in-utero paintings into the rosy walls of my mother&#8217;s womb. Now, I&#8217;m ready to give in totally to my creative inclinations.</p>
        <p>These impulses have presented in every decade of my life in ways that are as unique as those times and fashions, and my experiences radically changed just about every ten years.</p>
        <p>The college I attended taught strict, classical realism in a manor similar to Andrew Wyeth, a internationally recognized, regional superstar. I never quite nailed that, though I learned to look deeply at objects to understand the play of light that defines a textured surface. What I did discover was an affinity for line, the female form, atmospheric backgrounds and collage.</p>
        <p>In my late 20&#8217;s and early-30&#8217;s, I was busy creating a family of four. I married, bought a house, had two children and freelanced as a graphic artist around the Albany area. I did occasional editorial illustrations for magazines and produced advertising materials the old school way, with a rapidograph and t-square. I became a vivid PTA parent, hosting community events, classroom art classes, planting gardens, and growing a network of similarly situated friends in Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>I was invited by a fellow parent to become involved in a tiny school museum board. I eventually ended up Director of the little treasure trove (20,000 eclectic and amusing objects that had been hidden away in an attic) and spent seven of the happiest years of my life there. Every day, I&#8217;d stumble on a quirky discovery more fascinating than the day before. I curated temporary and new, permanent exhibits, threw countless fundraisers and reformed operations in order to be chartered as an independent entity of the school district, which we did.</p>
        <p>It was a colorful and richly rewarding time, which foreshadowed a decade of having just enough power to create impactful change in my city.</p>
        <p>At forty, I became involved with a waterfront revitalization project that I would end up inheriting for almost twenty years in a way that is personal and binding, building a new cityscape and park on the water, crowned with an undulating garden-bridge connecting the north and south shores. I also decided to run for office and won the top seat in city government.</p>
        <p>As Mayor, I initiated countless beautification and public art projects, cultural events, historic preservation efforts, and promoted revitalization endeavors that are still coming to fruition today. Some, like the restoration of City Hall and the wonderful mosaic on the East End are lasting and important to the heritage of our community. Others, like the meditation labyrinth at City Hall or certain murals and paintings have been removed or painted over. Never no mind. Beauty is transient.</p>
        <p>Many nights, to keep my sanity, I&#8217;d bead necklace and earring sets, embellish shells, or burn elaborate designs into wood. Art has kept me grounded in the wildest of tempests.</p>
        <p>I&#8217;m now well into another phase of my life; one that is more reflective but just as chaotic as any time before, even my teenage years. Two years ago, while cleaning out my attic, I found the portfolio of my college work and awoke a keen desire to revel in that voice that I echoed from so long ago.</p>
        <p>My greatest pleasure these days is in this, the discovery that happens every time I work through another project. I am eager to share this journey with others.</p>
