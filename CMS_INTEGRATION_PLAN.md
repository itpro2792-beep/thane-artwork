# Headless CMS Integration Plan

**Objective:** To connect the Astro frontend to a Sanity.io backend, making the website content fully manageable for Ann M. Thane.

**Status:** Blocked. The Sanity CLI requires an authenticated login to create a new project and generate the necessary `projectId`. As an AI, I cannot perform this step.

## Action Required

To complete this integration, please follow these steps:

1.  **Create a Sanity.io Account:**
    *   Visit [sanity.io/get-started](https://sanity.io/get-started).
    *   Sign up for a free account using GitHub or Google.

2.  **Initialize the Project:**
    *   Open a terminal in the `C:\\Antigravity Projects\\Website Creation for Mom\\studio` directory.
    *   Run the command: `npm create sanity@latest`
    *   When prompted, log in with the account you just created.
    *   Follow the on-screen prompts to create a new project. You can name it "Thane Artwork". Use the default "production" dataset.

3.  **Provide the Project ID:**
    *   Once the setup is complete, a file named `sanity.cli.js` (or `.ts`) will be created in the `/studio` directory.
    *   Open this file and find the `projectId`. It will look something like `'abcdef12'`.
    *   Provide me with this `projectId`.

**Once I have the `projectId`, I will be able to complete the integration.**

Thank you.
